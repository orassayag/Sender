## Instructions

===================
FAST & BASIC START.
===================
1. Open the project in IDE (Current to 01/12/2020 I'm using VSCode).
2. Open the following file in the src/settings/settings.js file.
3. Search for the first setting - 'IS_PRODUCTION_MODE' - Make sure it is on true.
4. Next - Time to install the NPM packages. On the terminal run 'npm i'.
   It will install automatically all the required NPM packages.
5. On terminal run 'npm start'. If everything goes well, you will start to see
   the console status line appear.
6. If you see any error - Need to check what's change. Current to 01/12/2020,
   It works fine.
7. If you see the console status line but the 'Sent' or 'Total' not progressing
	- Need to check what's wrong.
8. If no errors and the progress works OK, make sure to check on
   dist/production/date of today (Example: 1_20200316_222124)/ That the TXT
   file was created successfully.
